## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS (v3)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - JS library
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org)

### What I learned

Vue 3 new features, Pinia instead of Vuex as official store library. Trying to build a simple components using Options API.

### Continued development

For my next project in Vue, I would prefer using the Options API, just to have basic knowledge on both styles.
